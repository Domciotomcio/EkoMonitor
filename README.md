## Project Overview
The **Environmental Monitoring System** is a microservices-based system designed to collect, process, forecast, and present data related to environmental factors, such as air quality, humidity, and other indicators. The goal is to provide users with meaningful insights through a mobile app, a web app, and AI-powered forecasting capabilities.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Aggregates environmental data from IoT devices or other data sources.
- **Data Processing**: Processes and refines raw data for analysis.
- **AI Forecasting**: Predicts environmental changes using an AI model.
- **User Profiling**: Personalizes data presentation for each user.
- **User Management**: Manages user accounts, authentication, and authorization.
- **Data Presentation**: Offers both a mobile app for personalized insights and a web app for general data access.
