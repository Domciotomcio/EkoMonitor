1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/environmental-monitoring-system.git
   cd environmental-monitoring-system
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables** for API keys, database URLs, etc. Refer to `.env.example` for the required variables.

3. **Install dependencies** for each microservice (e.g., `requirements.txt` for Python services):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Database Setup**:
   - Set up the databases required by each module (e.g., `Data Aggregation DB`, `User Profile DB`).
   - Run migration scripts (if any).

5. **Run the microservices**:
   - Start each service independently or use a container orchestration tool like Docker Compose.

6. **Start the API Gateway**:
   - Configure and run the API Gateway to route requests between modules.
